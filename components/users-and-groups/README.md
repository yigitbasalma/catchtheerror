# User Groups and Users

## Create User Group

1. Click the plus sign next to the "Notification Groups" heading.

__Important Note:__ After the user is created, the name that appears on the user card is the user name defined on Zabbix, consisting of the e-mail address and customer ID. Username and password information is sent to the relevant user's e-mail account.
